 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

📌 Overview
Welcome to the **Weather Data Analysis** project! This C++ program allows users to input daily temperature data for a city over a month and provides meaningful insights, such as temperature trends, extreme values, and averages.

🚀 Features
✅ User-defined **number of days** in the month.  
✅ **Dynamic memory allocation** for efficient storage.  
✅ Stores **Minimum, Maximum, and Average** temperatures per day.  
✅ Identifies the **Hottest and Coldest** days of the month.  
✅ Computes the **Monthly Average Temperature**.  
✅ Displays **Temperature Trends** (increasing/decreasing patterns).  
✅ **Memory Management** – deallocates dynamically allocated memory.

🔧 How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of days in the month.
2. A **2D dynamically allocated array** is created to store temperature values.
3. The user inputs **minimum and maximum temperatures** for each day, and the program calculates the **average temperature**.
4. The program then:
   - Finds and displays the **hottest and coldest days**.
   - Computes and shows the **monthly average temperature**.
   - Identifies and prints **increasing and decreasing temperature trends**.
5. Finally, **allocated memory is properly deallocated** to ensure efficient memory usage.`

💡 Key Concepts Used
🔹 **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (`new`, `delete`)  
🔹 **2D Arrays** for structured data storage  
🔹 **Loops & Conditional Statements** for data processing  
🔹 **Mathematical Calculations** for temperature analysis  
🔹 **User Input Handling** for interactive experience  

🔮 Future Improvements
🚀 **Graphical Visualization** – Implement charts to visualize temperature trends.  
🚀 **File Handling** – Save and retrieve temperature data from external files.  
🚀 **Multi-city Support** – Extend functionality to compare multiple cities' weather.  
🚀 **GUI Interface** – Create a user-friendly graphical interface for better interaction.  

🖥️ Technologies Used
- **C++** – Core programming language used for implementation.  
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation** – Efficient storage handling for large datasets.  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** – To enhance data handling in future improvements.
